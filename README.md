# IG-bot
A simple bot that automates likes through various hashtags 

## How to use
It's quite easy, all you need to do is:
1. Fork the project onto your local computer.

2. Open the project and navigate towards the IGbot.py file. (remember you should be in the virtual environment)

3. Scroll to the profile section and add your credentials. (That is your password and username)

4. Scroll some more to the hashtags to add specific ones or just use the defaults I placed there.

5. Run the IGbot.py file only. (Please do have firefox installed since that's the browser used)

6. Done! just relax and let the bot do it's work
